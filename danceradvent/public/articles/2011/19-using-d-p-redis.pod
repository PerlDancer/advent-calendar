=head1 How to use Dancer::Plugin::Redis

Dancer::Plugin::Redis is a plugin created to make an easy way to use Redis database in Dancer apps. In fact, Dancer::Plugin::Redis is an abstraction from Redis plugin. It has only one function C<redis>, which returns a database handle. See Redis module documentation for the list of controlling functions.

=head1 Introduction to Redis

Redis is key-value, networking, in-memory data store with optional durability. It is very useful technology because it simple and fast. It supports many data types (integers, strings, sets, etc).
 
=head1 Synopsis

	use Dancer;
	use Dancer::Plugin::Redis;
	
	get '/404.html' => sub{
		my $data = redis->get('hash_key');
	};

	dance;

When you use C<redis> keyword it gives you a connected database handle or (if already connected) checks connection.
